### What is this repository for?

-   This package provides theoretical views of SZ y map and temperatures Tsz. This package also uses the SZpack ([please cite Chluba et al. 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426..510C) & [2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.430.3054C)) to generate observed SZ signals in any frequency from hydro-dynamical simulations.
-   It requires yt installed if you want to use yt to load and analysis the simulation data.
-   current version beta

### How do I get set up?

-   Summary of set up

    This package includes SZPack v1.1.1 library. It requires gsl (with headers files) and swig installed in your system for building this library. It is very easy with `sudo apt-get install libgsl23 libgsl-dev swig python-dev` You may need manually link the libgsl.so.0 (`sudo ln -s  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgsl.so.23.0.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgsl.so.0`) to solve the `ImportError: libgsl.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

    **Note for python3**: You may first need to install `python3-dev`. If you don't have the symbol link python to python3, go to the folder `cd pymsz/SZpacklib/python/` and modify the 'Makefile' by replacing 'python' with 'python3'. Then go back to the pymsz folder `cd ../../../` and run `python3 setup.py install --user`.

-   Configuration

    look at the wiki page for a simple test script. The functions inside this package are always documented.

-   Dependencies

    numpy, scipy, astropy. SZpack requires gsl and swig

### acknowledgement

-   Please cite the relative papers when you use the code.
-   The theoretical calculation is based on [Sembolini et al. 2013, MNRAS, 429, 323S](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429..323S)) and [Le Brun et al. 2015, MNRAS, 451, 3868](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stv1172)
-   The author owe a great debt to John ZuHone, who write the model for integrating SZpack to [yt-project](http://yt-project.org/). If you are using yt with SZpack to generate the mock SZ signals, please give your thanks to him.

### Temporary Notes

-   The loaded simulation data has a radius of 2 x set radius, because the data has to be projected in a cylinder. Thus, I make a cut in line of sight direction later before the calculation of theoretical y-map.

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for?

-   This package provides theoretical views of SZ y map and temperatures Tsz ([please cite Sembolini et al. 2013, MNRAS, 429, 323S](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429..323S)). This package also uses the SZpack ([please cite Chluba et al. 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426..510C) & [2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.430.3054C)) to generate observed SZ signals in any frequency from hydro-dynamical simulations.
-   It requires yt installed if you want to use yt to load and analysis the data.
-   version beta

### acknowledgement

-   Please cite the relative papers when you use the code.
-   The author owe a great debt to John ZoHone, who write the model for integrating SZpack to [yt-project](http://yt-project.org/). I shamelessly stole his code to make this package. Please also give your thanks to him.
